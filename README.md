This project is intended as a resource for learning the hebrew language. I hope for it to include utilities 
such as an alphabet and dictionary, as well as lessons for actually learning the language. Each of these tools
is intended to be as comprehensive as possible (something I haven't been able to find myself and my motivation for
making them). At the moment it's more of a way for me to organize what I have learned as I attempt to learn the 
language myself. Given that, the resources are a work in progress and could contain many errors (please tell me 
if you find any). If you find this useful at all please let me know!
